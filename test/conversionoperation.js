//We will talk about operations in JS.
let value = 59;
let valueOne = -value; //Here we changed the value from positive to negative and reassigned to valueOne.
console.log(valueOne); //It will print as -59.
                //Following Operations in JS Below

console.log(2+2);
console.log(9-5);
console.log(3/8);
console.log(7%5);

console.log("3" + 2 + 32 )//Guess what it will print to the console do you think it will print as 37? 
//Not really it won't print 37 because the operation won't succeed when there comes a string at first. So it considers the whole operation as a string.

console.log(2 + 5 + "23")
// Now here what do you think it will print 30 or not as above? Yes it will because the operation will succeed when there comes a string at last.
